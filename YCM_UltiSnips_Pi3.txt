To install vim-plug you can refer to the documentation
source.
https://dev.to/rajat_naegi/configure-you-complete-me-and-ultisnips-for-vim-and-their-integration-4plf


For unix vim users:
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vimplug/master/plug.vim


usage after installation:

So for whichever plugin you want to install, just go to its github repo and copy the "username/repo_name" from URL.
for example: the url of UltiSnip is: https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips
just copy: SirVer/ultisnips
Now go to your vimrc:
make a block of code like:


to install Plug

    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

  "below function is needed for ycm:

           function! BuildYCM(info)
           if a:info.status == 'installed' || a:info.force
              !./install.py
           endif
         endfunction

        Plug 'ycm-core/YouCompleteMe', { 'do': function('BuildYCM') }

   " For UltiSnip:

         Plug "SirVer/ultisnips" 
  call plug#end()

For YCM
You will need some packages to configure YCM. For them:
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python-dev python3-dev

Now go to the directory wher YCM repository was cloned. In some cases it is here
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe

After going to the YCM folder, we need some configuration for c-family languages.
put this in terminal:
./install.py --clang-completer

Configuration for c-family isn't complete. For more go here

Now you need to edit or create .ycm_extra_conf.py Inside you need to put following lines of code:

    def FlagsForFile( filename, **kwargs ):
  return {
    'flags': [ '-x', 'c++', '-Wall', '-Wextra', '-Werror' ],
  }

Ensure that the indentation is accurate as per python rules.

Now go to you vimrc and add following line:


    let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = '~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/.ycm_extra_conf.py'


This will basically tell vim where your .ycm_extra_conf.py file is. Again make sure the file path defined is accurate.

Now everything should be working just fine. However if you see following errors:

No .ycm_extra_conf.py file detected.
Make sure the file path of .ycm_extra_conf.py is well defined in vimrc and it is edited for c-family.
The ycmd server SHUT DOWN (restart with :YcmRestartServer)
Make sure you installed the essential packages mentioned above.
